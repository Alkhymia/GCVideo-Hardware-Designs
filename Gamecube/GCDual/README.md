GCDual is a hardware built around GCVideo. 

Three boards are needed:

Main PCB (Order in .8mm) https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ecQdlENy

HDMI QSB (Order in 1.6mm) https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/Zte7gvJZ

Main QSB (Order in 2mm) https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/8kE4x9eq

OSHPark does not produce 2mm boards so you will have to use another fabrication house.
